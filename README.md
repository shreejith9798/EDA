<h3>Loan Approval Analysis Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<h3>

Credit lending companies often face difficulties in making loan approval decisions when clients have no existing credit history. This leads to two major issues:
Business Loss: Not approving a loan for clients who are likely to repay can result in lost business opportunities.
Financial Loss: Approving loans for clients who are unlikely to repay can lead to financial losses.
This project aims to analyze loan applications and previous loan records using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to provide insights that can help credit lending companies make better loan approval decisions.
